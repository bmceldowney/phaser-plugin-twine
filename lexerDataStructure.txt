I’ve got a shipment of goods that never made it out of the docks.

I need someone to go out and “convince” the dockmaster to release my property.

<<if $reputation > 4>>
You seem like just the type for this sort of thing.
<<elseif $reputation < 0>>
Or maybe I'm better off asking someone else...
<<else>>
I'm apprehensive, but willing to give you a try.
<<endif>>
